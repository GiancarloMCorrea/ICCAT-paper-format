ICCAT working papers
============================

This is a Quarto template for producing working papers following the ICCAT format. This code was initially implemented by [Luis Lau](https://github.com/LuisLauM), and then adapted by myself.

You just need to modify the `template.qmd`. Store your images in the `image` folder.

The output format is a Word document (`.docx`), but it is not complety identical to the one required by ICCAT, so some post-processing may be required, but that will be easy and fast.

You can also change the styles and format using the `custom-reference-doc.docx` file. Be careful when doing that.

## Suggestions

Please, [contact me](mailto:gmoron@azti.es) if you have any suggestions or questions. My experience using Quarto and HTML is limited, but I will do my best to incorporate your comments.
